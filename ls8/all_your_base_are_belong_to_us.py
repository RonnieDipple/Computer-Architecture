# 2**0 = 1, 2**1=2 all the way to 10


#Learn base 16 aka hex or hexidecimal

#Binary
# 2** 0 = 1
# 2** 1 = 2

# Hex

#Version of 0b 0011 0101 = 53 below in hex

# Another one
# 0b11111111 = 0xFF = 255


# 0b 0011 0101 = 53 <- as a whole minus the 53 is called a byte and 0101 would be a nybble as would 0011
# highest number in a nybble is 0b1111 which is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15

# 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F 16 total values represented in hexidecimal
